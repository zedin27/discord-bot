# discord-bot

Learning how to create and use a discord bot with Python at the moment

## Run

`python3 pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Learning Process

From what I have gathered in the past, best practice to test out things in a specific environemnt is to use the `venv` from `pip3` for Python. Once installed, just run `source env/bin/activate`

If you already installed modules in the past and forgot to add it to the `requirements.txt`, simply run `pip install pipreqs && pipreqs <your_path_here_directory_folder_that_youre_working_on>`
